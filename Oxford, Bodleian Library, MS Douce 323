1. Beautiful knotted initial on 1r; decorated catchwords
2. Larger hand, decorated top line lines decorated with the red 1st letters
3. Capital letters dotted with red, but not all the way through
4. Paired brackets for rhymes

No title for the piers plowman text, though there is some decoration and it begins a whole new page.
The hand here is spacious to the point of being luxurious.  It’s running, connected, with lots of cursive and secretary features.  
Some underlining in red, but not universal.  More noticeable in the second book.
Red gothic letters desginate passuses in the margins and also some comments/notes

Skeat:

VI. MS. Douce 323; denoted hereafter by D. This is in a comparatively late hand (about 1480?), clearly written upon paper, each leaf about 11 inches by 8, with a very wide margin, about 31 lines to the page.  Contents. Fol. 1-101. A history of England, printed by Wynkyn de Word, 1515. Folio, under the title of “Fructus Temporum.” Begins—“In the noble lande of Surrye;” ends—“ withoute eny chalange of eny man. Amen. Deo gracias.” Fol. 102-140α; “Piers Plowman;” begins—“In A somer sesoun,” &c.; ends— 
	“Percen with a pater noster þe paleys of heuene
	With-oute penaunce at here partyng in-to heye blysse.
	Now of þis litel book y haue makyd an ende,
	Goddis blessyng mote he haue þat drinke wil me sende. 
		Explicit liber petri plouman.”
Fol. 140b—159b. The Abbey of the Holy Ghost, with a drawing of the Abbey on fol. 159b. Fols. 160-167. Sir Ypotyce, beginning “Alle þat will of wisdom lere;” ending—“And þankeþ god al his wille;” (imperfect?). This MS. Follows T rather closely, but is full of gross blunders.  On this account, after collating with Passus I.—IV., I desisted, finding that it only tended to choke the foot-notes with inferior readings.  But it was useful again for the latter part of Passus XI.

D MS Douce 323 Bodleian Library (S.C.21897)
Paper, a book of 167 leaves numbered in pencil, average size 11-11.125 x 8.25 inches. On fols. 102a-140a are copied Piers Plowman A Prologue-XI.  There are 28-34 lines per page of its text.
CONDITION
Except for loss of the last three leaves the manuscript is intact.  Dislocations of Piers Plowman content on fol.III (where III137-61 are copied after line 77) and on fols. 137b and 138a (where XI128-66 are misplaced after line 206) occurred in an antecedent copy.
HANDWRITING
One semi0cursive hand throughout the manuscript.  The letters þ and y are distinguished’ u and n are not.
DATE 
From handwriting, late fifteenth century. *Fn watermarks are a unicorn’s head, like Briquet 15841-43 and Zonghi 783-91, found on paper used after 1410.
HISTORY
Although the origin and early history of this manuscript are not confidently determinable, a fifteenth-century association with the eastern counties is not unlikely.
